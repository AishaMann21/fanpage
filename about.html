                <p>What is BTS? <br>
                BTS is a seven-member South Korean boy band formed by Big Hit Entertainment.
                BTS, also known as Bangtan Boys, is an acronym for the Korean expression Bangtan Sonyeondan,
                meaning Bulletproof Boy Scouts. In July 2017, they announced they'd also be known as Beyond
                the Scene as part of their new identity.</p>
                <p>When Did They Start? <br>

                The seven-member band was formed through auditions by Bit Hit Entertainment in 2010 and 2011, 
                and finalized in 2012. BTS made their musical debut in 2013 with the first of their school trilogy 
                series, their single album, 2 Cool 4 Skool. The group quickly became one of the hottest acts in South Korea,
                winning several New Artist of the Year awards. </p>

                  <p>What Happened Next? <br>

                BTS evolved their identity, channeling different themes throughout their music, through eras like School,
                The Most Beautiful Moment in Life and Wings. In just four years, the band has completed three world tours,
                released four studio albums (two in Korean and two in Japanese) and five EPs, gaining millions of fans across
                the world -- though it was their 2017 Billboard Awards win for Top Social Artist that marked the start of 
                their breakthrough in the U.S. </p>
                
                <p>What is ARMY?<br>

                ARMY (a fitting name for the organized passion of BTS fans) is actually an acronym for Adorable
                Representative MC for Youth. </p>
